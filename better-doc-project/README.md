Decription: BetterDoc is an app that details provider information to the user as well as practice locations near the user. The BetterDoc app will describe if the practices are accepting new patients as well as what insurances are accepted, phone numbers, and office hours. There will be a third navigation link that basically describes all the various specialties that a doctor may have if users wish to understand more about the complexties of specialties in the medical system and are stuck on what to search for. Post MVP, I plan to make a feature where users can login and save providers/practices that they wish to explore further and so that they have an address book all in one place for future reference. If there is time, I would also like to locate another API that would display health quotes and helpful information on the front page.

Component Heirarchy: 
  -Main page
    |
    -->About section and health quote (function components)
  -Provider information section
    |
    -->search bar/button and container for provider information(utilizing a class component)
  -Practice information
    |
    -->search bar/button and container for practice information(utilizing a class component)
  -Specialty definitions
    |
    -->search bar/button that displays all specialty information(utilizing a function component)


API: BetterDoctor API -- > https://developer.betterdoctor.com/

MVP:
-Have a thoroughly developed README.md file. 
-Have an interactice React app, built using create react app.
-Utilize React Router.
-Have at least 6 separate, rendered components.
-Implement an organized and understandable React file structure.
-Utilize functional and class React components appropriately.
-Use Axios to consume data from an third party API, and render that data in the components. 
-Use only React for DOM Manipulation.
-Have styling through CSS.
-Use flexbox or CSS Grid for rending and styling of provider information.
-Make sure that the design is scalable and responsive to mac, tablet, and mobile.
-Have proper indentation.
-Utilize high-quality, semantic variable names.
-Follow camelCase and kebab-case conventions.
-Remove unnecessary boilerplate React files and code.
-Remove all console.logs and commented out code.
-Host the BetterDoc app on Surge.
-Have GitHub commits every day.


Post-MVP:
-Locate and use another API that renders health quotes and helpful information on the front page.
-Create login capabilities so that users can "favorite" and save preferred provider information.


SWOT Analysis: 
Strengths going into the project include my design skills and thuroughness in completion of projects. I pride myself in being very detail oriented. Weaknesses and opportunities include learning more about how functions and classes are written in react. Threats include users not taking the happy path and writing in specifc providers in the address bar, which I can account for and create a fix for that during the project.
